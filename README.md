This is currently just a catch-all folder for files created while working though various courses & tutorials for: RHEL, BASH, Vim, etc. Or, more generally, command line Linux related exercises.

Files found here may, or may not, be exemplary of what I was learning since I try to follow along with tutorials & courses from beginning to end in hopes that "any moment -- we'll get to the good stuff!" ;)
